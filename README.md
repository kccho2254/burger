# burger
## Description

### [Deployed to Heroku](https://burger-logger-119922833.herokuapp.com/)
### [Repository on Github](https://github.com/kccho2254/burger)


This is an app that allows the user to type in burger names, indicate whether they are eaten or not, click buttons to eat them, which places them in the "eaten" column, and trash the burgers that have been eaten. This app follows the MVC model, where inputs are saved to a MySQL web server, operated through Express and Node to route data, and which serves HTML through Handlebars.

To be able to save your own notes, you must clone this repo and run it from http://localhost:3000.
